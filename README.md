Elexis for server operation

The Elexis server (ES) implements a part of the SMART specification. Please consult [SMART: Tech Stack for HealthApps](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/) and  [HL7-FHIR wiki](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR) for further details.

## BREAKING CHANGES

As of current development or ES 1.8, suport for the following services/components is removed:

* ES will not provide HTTPS services
* OpenID is not integrated in ES anymore
* Only product builds for linux x86_64 are made

If you want to operate ES standalone with authentication/authorization support, [Elexis-Environment](https://github.com/elexis/elexis-environment) is your solution.

## Build

Requires maven 3.3 and java 8. Build can be started by executing `mvn -f releng/es.parent/pom.xml clean verify -DskipTests` 

## Configuration, startup and checking the elexis server

Documented in [es.core.product.runtime](products/es.core.product.runtime/Readme.md).

## Running inside docker

Use the following command to start an elexis-server docker image, omit (for latest) or replace `:tag` with the [tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/medevit/elexis-server/tags/) to use. 

```bash
docker run -e DEMO_MODE='true' -e TZ=Europe/Zurich -p 8380:8380 -p 8480:8480 -p 7234:7234 medevit/elexis-server:tag
```

After initially creating a container out of this image (which is what the `run` command does), note
the ID of the created instance, in order to restart it again afterwards. Repeatedly executing this command, always leaves
you with a newly generated container.

After startup point your browser to http://localhost:8380/services/elexis/connector/v1/status to get information on the database ES is connected to.
